	<h1>About Dolpan</h1>
	<p>
	The Dolpan Society was launched on Nov. 3, 2019, by Elizabeth “Bemi” DeBus and Dr. Clark Cameron. Their mission is to protect the habitats of whales, dolphins, and porpoises through public education and outreach programs, together with the rewarding of research grants to conservation researchers. Recent ACS grant recipients include John Wang of FormosaCetus Research in Ontario, Canada, and Casey Clark of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.

ACS’ education program involves the distribution of teaching guides and curricula to school teachers nationwide, to help spread awareness of cetaceans’ needs amongst young people. The organization names its core values as: integrity and transparency, credibility and independence; commitment to strategic partnerships; and commitment to sound science.

      <h1><br>Are Dolphins Endangered?</h1>
      <p><br>Several species and subspecies of dolphin are threatened and the reasons are all man-made. Many human activities, whether done intentionally or by accident, have adverse environmental impacts and result to the decline of dolphin population and increase their risk of becoming extinct.

      Animals across the world, including dolphins, are facing issues that threaten their existence. In 2006, a freshwater species of dolphin was declared functionally extinct. Its extinction was mainly attributed to the destruction of its habitat.</p>

    	<h1><br>Meet The Dolphin Man of India</h1>
     <p><br>Ravindra Kumar Sinha (born 1 July 1954) is a Padma Shri awarded Indian biologist and environmentalist. Currently, he is Vice-Chancellor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University and formerly of Nalanda Open University. Previously he was the Head of the Department of Zoology at Patna University, and is a pioneer researcher and wildlife conservationist, famous for his efforts for the conservation of Gangetic Dolphins, he is popularly known as the <b>"Dolphin Man of India"</b> .

     His scientific research and relentless conservation campaign for the last 4 decades have been crucial to the efforts of saving the Ganga River dolphin from extinction. In response to the awareness of the urgency of protecting the Ganga River dolphin raised by Sinha, the Government of India designated this Dolphin as the National Aquatic Animal of India in 2009.</p>

     <h1><br>Why save Dolphins?</h1>
     <p><br>Dolphins play an important role in keeping their environment in balance. They eat other animals – mainly fish and squid – and are themselves a source of food for some sharks and other creatures.

     Without dolphins, the animals they prey on would increase in number, and their predators wouldn’t have as much to eat. This would disrupt the natural balance in the food chain and could negatively affect other wildlife and the health of the ocean environment.
 
     By protecting dolphins we’re helping look after our oceans – and that’s good for all the wildlife and billions of people who depend on the sea.</p>
